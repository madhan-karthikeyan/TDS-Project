# TDS Virtual TA â€” FastAPI-based RAG with OCR Assistant

This project is a backend API application designed as a virtual teaching assistant for the IIT Madras Tools in Data Science (TDS) course. It uses FastAPI along with LangChain and vector-based retrieval to answer student questions using course content and forum discussions. It also supports OCR-based question extraction from uploaded images.

## Features

- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using LangChain and Chroma vector store
- Custom prompt logic with strict content constraints and fallback behaviors
- RESTful API with image-based OCR support using pytesseract
- Automatic extraction of source URLs and inline link filtering
- Configurable with API tokens for external model providers
